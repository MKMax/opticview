/**
 * Manages a collection of {@link javafx.beans.value.ObservableValue} objects
 * and merges any change events emitted by said objects into a single chain
 * of event handlers.
 * <p>
 * When designing complex components, it is often required to listen to many
 * events and execute some method when some related values are changed. For example,
 * when a component requires an update each time it is resized, it would be
 * beneficial to group the {@code widthProperty()} and {@code heightProperty()}
 * so that only a single method is executed intercepting the change event.
 * <br><br>
 * Furthermore, grouping such properties and the respective event handlers reduces
 * verbosity of the client code, which is ultimately the aim of this class. Sure,
 * you can achieve the same functionality mentioned previously using multiple
 * {@link javafx.beans.value.ChangeListener} objects, but maintaining that becomes
 * a hassle rather quickly.
